    <p>My name is Jen McPhail. In April 2016 I decided I was going to learn how to code.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I had been toying with HTML, CSS, and JS since I was a preteen (s/o to my totally dope MySpace profile circa 2006.), and had been obsessed with internet culture for as long as I was old enough to wait impatiently for the modem on our Gateway PC to dial up before clicking on the Internet Explorer icon. But somewhere along the way, I had convinced myself that I wasn't good enough at math to become a real programmer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Fast forward about ten years, one failed attempt at a drama degree, one successful attempt at a public relations degree and several digital marketing jobs later, I realized I wasn't really doing what I loved. So I took the plunge, headed to a coding bootcamp, and came out the other side a bonafide web developer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This website is a collection of all the dev work I'm most proud of. Please take a look around. If you like what you see, get in touch by following me on social media, or reaching out via the contact page.</p>
